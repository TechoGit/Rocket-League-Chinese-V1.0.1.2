# Rocket-League-Chinese-V1.0.1.2
Archived Downloadable Build of Free to Play Version of Chinese Rocket League (Won't work as DRM)

he following is a China exclusive only build of Rocket League which was last updated on 16th of January 2020 called V1.0.1.2 

for the past few years the chinese build of Rocket League has been considered lost software for many years but luckily i managed to track down a build on 29th of January 2025 and was able to get it 

now i'm uploading it onto the Internet Archive for software preservation

this build contains Tecent Games Client / QA related things that will make it unable to launch and having anti cheat on top of the client, also contains exclusive chinese rocket league items relating to Hatsune Miku via the game files which have already been archived onto github a few months ago

I've only posted this writeup on Github so its more easier to find as the Build has been preserved on the Web Archive which you can find here https://archive.org/details/rocket-league-chinese-edition-v-1.0.1.2
